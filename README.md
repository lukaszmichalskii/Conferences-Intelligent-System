## Conferences Intelligent System
The task of this project was to create an intelligent system supporting industry conferences.

The application receives the input path to the file with data about each conference participant 
and the number of suggestions to be made. The result is a proposal of people who may be of interest 
to each of the conference participants. The Match function finds the best combinations based on each 
participant's profession and area of interest. The calculations determining the suggestions are based on 
two algorithms: [brute force technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search) and [genetic algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-optimization-with-genetic-algorithm-2f5001d9964b).
